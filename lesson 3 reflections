When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working on a project with multiple people or if you often switch between computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you are working on your master branch locally and you don't want to pull in the master from GitHub yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    You would fork a repository instead of cloning it when you don't have permission to make changes to the original repository
    and you want to link back to it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can see what changed in the remote branch since you last pulled/pushed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Probably by using email or Google Drive. It would be easier because you wouldn't have to 
	learn all of the Git commands and aspects of GitHub. But it would be harder to make changes
	on the same files and then try to merge them together without deleting vital information.
	Also, it would be harder to experiment with your code without affecting the master.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You'd want to make changes in a separate branch when you're experimenting with your code or 
	making a major change. The benefit of that is that if it doesn't work out, you can just delete
	that branch. Otherwise, you can merge it with the master.
